### configuration for pm-utils power hooks

## journal-commit hook

# number of seconds between journal commits (ext3/4 only)
JOURNAL_COMMIT_TIME_AC=0
JOURNAL_COMMIT_TIME_BAT=600


## laptop_mode hook

# LAPTOP_MODE=value for laptop_mode on battery.
# Defaults to 5, which enables laptop mode and forces the system to wait
# 5 seconds whenever something asks to write to disk to flush out as much
# data as we can.
LAPTOP_MODE=5

# LAPTOP_DIRTY_RATIO=the ratio of dirty memory to all memory that
# processes start doing their own writeout.
# Defaults to 60, which means that the kernel will not start forcing process
# to write out file information that has been changed but not saved until 60%
# of usable system memory is filled with dirty information.
LAPTOP_DIRTY_RATIO=60

# LAPTOP_DIRTY_BG_RATIO=The ratio of dirty memory to all memory that
# pdflush will wake up and start writing to disk.
# Defaults to 40, which means that the kernel will wake up a helper process
# to try and write out dirty memory once 40% of usable system memory is dirty.
LAPTOP_DIRTY_BG_RATIO=40

# LAPTOP_DIRTY_WRITEBACK=The number of centiseconds between periodic
# wakeups of the pdflush daemons.
# Defaults to 60000 (10 minutes), which menas that the kernel will flush dirty
# memory every 10 minutes if dirty memory never hits 40% of system memory.
LAPTOP_DIRTY_WRITEBACK=60000

# Defaults to 3072 KB.
