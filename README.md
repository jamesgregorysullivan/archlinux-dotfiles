# Jakub Klinkovsk√Ω's configuration files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/lahwaacz/archlinux-dotfiles.git
    cd archlinux-dotfiles

And now copy the files anywhere you want.


## Environment

### Software

My OS is Archlinux, but it will most likely work on any Linux 
distribution. I primarily use zsh, but I've included some older
bash files as well. As a desktop environment I use highly modified
LXDE with Openbox.


### Hardware

My laptop, Asus M51Va, has some specific configurations, such as
ACPI, multimedia keys etc. It's possible this configuration will 
work on some different piece of HW, but I wouldn't count on that.
